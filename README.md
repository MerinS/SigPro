# SigProAudio
Python codes to work with Audio

The library majorly deals with codes involving processing audio data for watermark encoding and decoding.There is inbuilt scrambling using a pseudorandom sequence as well for keeping the watermark secure. There is a section on error correction using Low-Density Parity Checks(LDPC) to further aid in securing the watermark and for improving the decoding rates.
