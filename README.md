# SigProAudio
Python codes to work with Audio

The library majorly deals with codes involving processing audio data for watermark encoding and decoding.
There is inbuilt scrambling using a pseudorandom sequence as well for keeping the watermark secure.

There is also a section on error correction which is purely experimental. Right now, it would be wise to ignore 
those as they are under development. I will update the readme when I have done a good job at it.
